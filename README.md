# Project Overview:
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) README of my project. In this document, I will provide an in-depth overview of the project's main objectives and the three key phases it encompasses. The primary goal of this project is to gain valuable insights from a MongoDB sample dataset through data scraping, dataset cleanup, and pre-processing, followed by data visualization and trend analysis using Tableau. Let's delve into each of these phases:

# Phase 1: Scraping Data from MongoDB Sample Dataset
In this initial phase, the project focuses on retrieving data from a MongoDB sample dataset. MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database, and this dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis. We employ web scraping techniques to access and extract the data we need for the exploratory analysis.

Tasks in this Phase:
Establishing a connection to the MongoDB database.

Identifying the target collection or document in the database.

Extracting relevant data from MongoDB using appropriate queries and filters.

# Phase 2: Dataset Cleanup and Pre-processing
Having obtained the data, the next crucial step is to prepare it for meaningful analysis. This phase focuses on data cleansing, transformation, and pre-processing to ensure the dataset's quality and consistency.

Key Activities:
Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing or erroneous data points.

Data Transformation: Converting data types, dealing with outliers etc

# Phase 3: Data Visualization and Trend Analysis using Tableau
The final and most visually impactful phase involves the use of Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The aim is to create compelling visualizations that convey meaningful insights and trends hidden within the data.

Activities in this Phase:

Data Visualization: Developing interactive and informative visualizations that present the data in a clear and engaging manner.

Trend Analysis: Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis.

# Conclusion
This README provides an overview of my project's main objectives and the three key phases: scraping data from the MongoDB sample dataset, dataset cleanup and pre-processing, and data visualization and trend analysis using Tableau. Each phase plays a vital role in the quest to extract meaningful insights from the data.

As we progress through these phases, we will document our findings and share the visualizations and insights generated. The ultimate aim of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the data and draw actionable conclusions that can inform decision-making and drive future analysis
